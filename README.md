# Fashion-MNIST
we are classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset using neural networks.

Here I have used the dataset from the superdatascience team.
Although the dataset can be loaded using Keras.

This code explains the step by step procedure of buiding the model and visualizing the dataset.
This is a neural network model with accuracy of 91%.
